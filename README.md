🛍️ Product-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
This project performs text preprocessing and sentiment analysis on a dataset of product reviews to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. The analysis involves data cleaning, stopword removal, and the use of machine learning models to predict sentiment.

📂 Project Structure

README.md: Overview of the project (this file).

🧠 Objectives
Clean and preprocess raw product reviews.

Remove stopwords using NLTK.

Convert text to numerical format using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.

Train machine learning models for sentiment classification.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Steps performed include:

Handling missing values.
